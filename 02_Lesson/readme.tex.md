# Lesson 2: 



* **Displacements**. As in Lesson 1, the vertical strain after Step 1 (gravity) is $\epsilon_{33} = -1.3\times10^{-4}$.

	In Step 2, the modulus $E$ is dropped from $1000$ to $1$ through field variable $\#1$. Therefore, at the end of Step 2, the vertical strain should be $1000$ times larger, at $\epsilon_{33} = -1.3\times10^{-1}$. 	
	Also, the lateral strain $\epsilon_{11} = \epsilon_{22}$ is:
	$$
	\begin{align}
	\epsilon_{22} &=& \dfrac{1}{E}\left[ \left(1+\nu\right) \sigma_{22} - \nu\left(\sigma_{11}+\sigma_{22}+\sigma_{33}\right) \right] = 0.039\\
	\end{align}
	$$
	
	where $E = 1$ and $\nu = 0.3$.	These values jibe with the contour plots below.
	
	In Step 3, the modulus $E=1$ is kept constant, while the Poisson's ratio $\nu$ is dropped from $0.3$ to $0.2$ through field variable $\#2$. Therefore, at the end of Step 3, the lateral strain is:
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	\epsilon_{22} &=& \dfrac{1}{E}\left[ \left(1+\nu\right) \sigma_{22} - \nu\left(\sigma_{11}+\sigma_{22}+\sigma_{33}\right) \right] = 0.026\\
	\end{align}
	$$
			
	where $E = 1$ and $\nu = 0.2$.	These values jibe with the contour plots below.



## Exercise 

* The vertical strain $\epsilon_{33}$ did not change during Step 3. Why? Hint: Calculate $\epsilon_{33}$ using linear elasticity above.
